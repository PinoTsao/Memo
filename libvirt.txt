## Storage management

[libvirt storage management](https://libvirt.org/storage.html)
Terms: storage pool, volumn. A storage pool is a quantity of storage set aside by an administrator.
Storage pools are divided into storage volumes, and the volumes are assigned to VMs as block devices.

举例来说，一个准备给VM使用的 NFS server 的路径：nfs.example.com:/path/to/share 就是一个 pool.
Once the pool is started, the files in the NFS share are reported as volumes.

Storage pools and volumes 并不是必须的，they provide a way for libvirt to ensure that a particular
piece of storage will be available for a VM. On systems that do not use pools, system administrators
must ensure the availability of the VMs' storage using whatever tools they prefer, for example, 
adding the NFS share to the host's fstab so that the share is mounted at boot time.
